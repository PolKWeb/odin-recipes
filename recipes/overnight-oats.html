        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

        <p>Overnight Oats are a staple breakfast. This delicious, and fully nutritious meal will take you less than ten minutes to create. Overnight oats are a great source of carbs and proteins: exactly what your body needs for a boost of energy in the morning.</p>

        <p>Once you are done preparing them, simply put them in the fridge overnight. The chia seeds will slowly soak in the milk, turning the oats into a pudding like texture.</p>
